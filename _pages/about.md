I'm currently a Doctoral student at the University of Bonn, my focus is on developing methods and techniques that tackle the challenges of uncertainty estimation and explainability within Deep Learning models for Crops monitoring.

My journey, spanning diverse disciplines, has profoundly encouraged me to venture into the realms of Deep Learning across various domains. This exploration led me to the field of Medicine, which held a special place in my heart during my MSc. thesis. Eagerness to learn is a constant driving force in my life. I'm always enthusiastic about expanding my horizons, as I believe in the complementary nature of science, where fields, in the end, are connected somehow.

My research focuses on Applied Deep learning across various domains, with a primary emphasis on computer vision applications in Crop monitoring and Medicine.

## Main Research Directions

### 1. Uncertainty Quantification  
Developing principled, distribution-free methods to measure, interpret, and control predictive uncertainty, with emphasis on reliability under distribution shift and real-world conditions.

### 2. Explainability and Interpretability  
Designing model-agnostic and model-aware techniques that provide transparent insights into model decision-making, including occlusion analysis, and concept-level interpretability.

### 3. Self-Supervised Learning  
Exploring representation learning approaches that leverage unlabeled data to learn robust and semantically meaningful features, and studying their impact on downstream tasks such as classification, anomaly detection, and uncertainty estimation.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
