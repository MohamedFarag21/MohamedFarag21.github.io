I'm currently a Doctoral student at the University of Bonn, my focus is on developing methods and techniques that tackle the challenges of uncertainty estimation and explainability within Deep Learning models for Crops monitoring.

My journey, spanning diverse disciplines, has profoundly encouraged me to venture into the realms of Deep Learning across various domains. This exploration led me to the field of Medicine, which held a special place in my heart during my MSc. thesis. Eagerness to learn is a constant driving force in my life. I'm always enthusiastic about expanding my horizons, as I believe in the complementary nature of science, where fields, in the end, are connected somehow.

My research focuses on Applied AI across various domains, with a primary emphasis on computer vision applications in Crop monitoring and Medicine.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
